    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Compare this behavior to that of the while loop. What are the similarities? What are the differences?</h3>
    <p>The repeat-while loop executes the statements within the body of the loop which is something a while doesn't do. Instead, the condition, the Boolean test, is evaluated in a while loop. Both of them do test two conditionals and create a loop according to those conditionals.</p>
    <h3>What are the minimum number of times that this loop will execute?</h3>
    <p>The minimum number that this loop will be executed is 1.</p>
    <h3>What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the Jump instruction is so that the loop can go back to the beginning of the loop.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a while loop using a repeat-while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.</h3>
    <p>Both while loop and repeat-while loop will execute the same number of times. In the below example, if the initial value of variable x=3 (meaning the condition is false), then while loop  will give different result. But if the first value of x is 6, both executions will give same result.</p>

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 600px;">Repeat-While Loop:</h2>
    <p> 
      <center>var x = 3</center>
      <center>repeat { </center>
      <center>print("something")</center>
      <center>x -= 1 </center>
      <center>print(x)</center>
      <center>} while (x > 4)</center>
      <center>print("random")</center>
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 650px;">The output would be: </h3>
    <p>
      <center>something</center>
      <center>2</center>
      <center>random</center>
    </p>

    
    <h2 style="margin-left: 650px;">While Loop:</h2>
    <p>
      <center>var x = 3</center>
      <center>while (x > 4) { </center>
      <center>print("something") </center>
      <center>x -= 1</center>
      <center>print (x)</center>
      <center> } </center>
      <center>print ("random")</center>
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 650px;">The output would be: </h3>
    <p>
      <center>random</center>
    </p>
    
    <p>Based on the results, you can see that the repeat-while loop doesn't function the same way that a while loop does because it prints a statement first instead of running the condition first.</p>
    
    <h3>Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a repeat-while loop using a while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.</h3>
    <p>In the above example for question 1 in section 2, the while loop will not print a statement before checking the condition. Only if the initial value of a variable used in the condition is true. In this case both repeat-while loop and while loop execute the block of code the same number of times.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What was the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned about the functionality of repeat-while loops and the statements/format to run them.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I didn't encounter any challenges because repeat-while loops are pretty similar to while loops which I was confidently able to do in the previous unit.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience is at it's best.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>Now that I know what repeat-while loops are used for and how to use them, I can use this type of loop if I want to repeatedly execute a program and if that is interrupted, I can go to the next condition that I can mention to do something else.</p>
