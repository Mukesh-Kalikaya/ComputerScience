    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction â‰¢?</h3>
    <p>The 3 dashes represent equality and the slash through those 3 dashes represent a no-equal sign which basically represents not being equal to.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2n?</h3>
    <p>The number of rows that a truth-table needs is determined by the number of basic statement letters involved in the set of formulas that will be used.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What was the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned about Boolean Algebra</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered no challenges.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I had no challenges so this experience is at its best.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I never even heard of the topic Boolean Algebra so I just found out what it was and how to use it.</p>
